I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering.html) at the [University at Buffalo, SUNY](https://www.buffalo.edu/). Additionally, I am affiliated with the faculty cluster in Artificial Intelligence (AI) within [the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS)](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/).

My research focuses on computer vision and machine learning, aiming to enhance the reliability and robustness of models. I engage in applied research, drawing from ideas and concepts found in statistics, optimization, and mathematical literature related to modern deep neural networks.

I earned my PhD in 2023 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I had the privilege of being advised by [Vikas Singh](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~vsingh/). Throughout my doctoral studies, I had valuable internships at [Google Research (twice)](https://research.google/) and at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/). Earlier, I received my BTech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur in 2016, under the guidance of [Laxmidhar Behera](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~lbehera/).

**I am actively seeking collaborations and highly motivated Ph.D. candidates, as well as M.S. students at UB. Interested individuals are encouraged to [apply here](https://forms.gle/9jzFC42BKVRm7jxKA).**

**Additionally, I am also enthusiastic about exploring opportunities for industrial collaborations.**
